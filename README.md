## DataGlyph
SPC-SF Hybrid Visualization (Bird Glyphs)
This Repository contains the code for a data visualization method I developed for the Visual Knowledge Discovery and Imaging Lab at Central Washington University.

The visualization method is glyph based, and allows for the lossless and reversible visualization of high-dimensional data. The GUI is developed in C++ with Qt.
